# Relationship-Compatibility-Tracker
This project, titled DreLoMat, is a playful yet insightful relationship compatibility tracker that evaluates the compatibility between two individuals based on various factors. Whether for fun or to explore data-driven matching, this project uses Python to compute and visualize compatibility in an engaging and interactive way.

Project Overview
The notebook walks through a compatibility analysis between two users by:
- Taking basic input data (names, preferences, dates, scores, etc.)
- Applying logical or numerical algorithms to generate a compatibility score
- Displaying meaningful interpretations with fun or insightful messaging
- Using visualizations to make the experience more interactive

This project is great for exploring data preprocessing, interactive inputs, string manipulation, and basic logic-based data analysis in Python.

Features
- Input-based relationship scoring logic
- Custom scoring algorithm based on names, preferences, etc.
- Compatibility percentage calculation
- Visualizations using Python plotting libraries
- Optional future enhancements like zodiac sign match or birth date numerology

Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
